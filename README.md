# C++ Code Collection

Welcome to my repository of C++ projects! This collection includes various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects showcasing concepts such as **classes**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **encapsulation**, and **abstraction**.

## Projects Included:

1. **Library Management System**  
   A system for managing books, including adding, removing, checking out, and returning books.

2. **Bank Management System**  
   A system for managing bank accounts with features such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.

3. **Student Management System**  
   A student management system that handles student details, courses, and research topics.

## Key Concepts:

- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes to maintain security and integrity.
- **Inheritance**: Derived classes extend functionality from base classes, enabling code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods are overridden to provide specific behaviors for different types of objects.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex systems by providing a clear interface to interact with objects.

## Getting Started:

Clone this repository to explore the code examples or use them as a reference for your own projects. To compile and run, use any C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or Visual Studio).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-projects.git
cd cpp-projects
g++ -o main main.cpp
./main
```
